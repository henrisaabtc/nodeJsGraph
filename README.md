<h2>1 - Create an Azure Web App for an one hour trial to host this REST API</h2>
So let's deploy a Node.js REST API into this type of Azure App Service, totally free and without any commitment 
For enjoying this Azure feature, reach the welcome page of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/try/app-service/">"Try Azure App Service"</a>

<br>
<br>
You are then invited to choose the type of App Service you want to try. Let's start with a Web App. You will see that you can totally use a Web App for hosting a REST API, Node.js will appear at the next step. Select the Web App, then click Next. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
Let's choose the Node.js + Express now. Click on "Create".
<br>You can use one of the 4 social networks account to sign in : Microsoft (live), Google +, Facebook, Github. For the demonstration I will use my Live account.

<br>
<br>
Open a command prompt and navigate to your code repositery. Then type 
<br>
code . 
<br>
To open the folder in Visual Studio code
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NJCRa9IC43s/WesauNIyzgI/AAAAAAAATfE/xeVTkO31AQUx7R_VvnkwonRJVYVfDZNJgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B23%2B-%2Bopening%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NJCRa9IC43s/WesauNIyzgI/AAAAAAAATfE/xeVTkO31AQUx7R_VvnkwonRJVYVfDZNJgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B23%2B-%2Bopening%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode.png" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
Then, open your Visual Studio Code IDE Integrated Terminal
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rCjCtpwvQk4/WesbMV8t8GI/AAAAAAAATfM/f2k-z65AUm8FsTec7B1fDBcjYsRPDoQOwCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B24%2B-%2Bopening%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rCjCtpwvQk4/WesbMV8t8GI/AAAAAAAATfM/f2k-z65AUm8FsTec7B1fDBcjYsRPDoQOwCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B24%2B-%2Bopening%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal.png" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0XoEtUJEYYU/Wesa_I7cubI/AAAAAAAATfI/nLo880BPO_EBEaimUh3LIQl35WKVPdD2wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B25%2B-%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0XoEtUJEYYU/Wesa_I7cubI/AAAAAAAATfI/nLo880BPO_EBEaimUh3LIQl35WKVPdD2wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B25%2B-%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal.png" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
First we have to create a git reference, so type 
<br>git init . 
<br>in the Integrated Terminal of Visual Studio Code. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_m5mQBPtB8I/Wessxc47ObI/AAAAAAAATfg/Lyg5PLEpvh8RwsXmHitCp2_n5swxBbE-wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B26%2B-%2Bvisual%2Bstudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal%2Bgit%2Binit%2B.%2Bcommand.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_m5mQBPtB8I/Wessxc47ObI/AAAAAAAATfg/Lyg5PLEpvh8RwsXmHitCp2_n5swxBbE-wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B26%2B-%2Bvisual%2Bstudio%2Bcode%2Bintegrated%2Bterminal%2Bgit%2Binit%2B.%2Bcommand.png"  class="screenshot-large"  /></a>
<br>
<br>
You will notice that a .git file has been added to the to level of your project. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nZd8JZ2O8H0/WestDUjuNOI/AAAAAAAATfk/vMCKFR40QFQS4SAMVA3XEHDKuw7ubBKLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B27%2B-%2B.git%2Bfile%2Bcreated.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nZd8JZ2O8H0/WestDUjuNOI/AAAAAAAATfk/vMCKFR40QFQS4SAMVA3XEHDKuw7ubBKLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B27%2B-%2B.git%2Bfile%2Bcreated.png"  class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
Now we have to add reference of all our project file to the git, so type
<br>
git add . 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LM78B5H0RK0/WestUWDOsvI/AAAAAAAATfs/tPtu0NZJz5cRfR8kPTp9j4naTNijoCKwgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B27%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bafter%2Bgit%2Badd%2B.%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LM78B5H0RK0/WestUWDOsvI/AAAAAAAATfs/tPtu0NZJz5cRfR8kPTp9j4naTNijoCKwgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B27%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bafter%2Bgit%2Badd%2B.%2B.png" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
Because it is our first push to another remote repositery we have to commit all the items of our project, so type
<br>
git commit -m "initial version"
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8qPs1mnD67A/WestwMXxRFI/AAAAAAAATfw/X2yKRO9DFq0SBE6uzzp-VOrCFFTu0IHWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B28%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bafter%2Bgit%2Bcommit%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8qPs1mnD67A/WestwMXxRFI/AAAAAAAATfw/X2yKRO9DFq0SBE6uzzp-VOrCFFTu0IHWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B28%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bafter%2Bgit%2Bcommit%2B.png" data-original-width="1353" data-original-height="837"  class="screenshot-large"  /></a>
<br>
<br>
We are ready to push our project items into our Azure API App Service. First we have to add a reference to this App Service deployment with git, so go back to the "Try Azure App Service" page (you will notice your current running App Service will be retrieved even though you have closed your browser. In the page click on the "Clone or push with git" button to make the git url appear. Copy the Url. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A0BfssImHVU/WesvWMDjWTI/AAAAAAAATf8/TlJqU7rd8mgGdis7sowTwzVQDKAcbgtxgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B31%2B-%2BTry%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2BUI%2B-%2BGet%2BLink%2Bto%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-A0BfssImHVU/WesvWMDjWTI/AAAAAAAATf8/TlJqU7rd8mgGdis7sowTwzVQDKAcbgtxgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B31%2B-%2BTry%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2BUI%2B-%2BGet%2BLink%2Bto%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B.png" class="screenshot-large"/></a>
<br>
<br>
Going back to Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal, we are going to deploy into our Azure App Service. Type
<br>
git remote add azure 
<br>
and paste the url you have previously copied from the "Try Azure App Service" UI. 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CuiVU-HUrDY/WeswPeuoGsI/AAAAAAAATgE/rCR9dze8QRgrsGQENrR-01Oa2gxQu2duACLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B29%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bgit%2Bremote%2Badd%2Bazure.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CuiVU-HUrDY/WeswPeuoGsI/AAAAAAAATgE/rCR9dze8QRgrsGQENrR-01Oa2gxQu2duACLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B29%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bgit%2Bremote%2Badd%2Bazure.png" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
Then execute the push command for deploying:
<br>
git remote push azure master
<br>
<br>
The Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal will be extremely verbose giving you a lot of details regarding the deployment. 
<br>

<br>
<br>
and the most expected: Deployment successful.
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GAhDOLRSPGo/WesxmYN4-vI/AAAAAAAATgc/FTAqDEbQzOsvP5Mr_T-66oM01_ZJeLu2wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B34%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bgit%2Bremote%2Badd%2Bazure%2B%252B%2Bgit%2Bpush%2Bazure%2Bmaster%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-GAhDOLRSPGo/WesxmYN4-vI/AAAAAAAATgc/FTAqDEbQzOsvP5Mr_T-66oM01_ZJeLu2wCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B34%2B-%2Bgit%2Bcommands%2Bin%2BVisual%2BStudio%2Bcode%2BIntegrated%2BTerminal%2B-%2Bgit%2Bremote%2Badd%2Bazure%2B%252B%2Bgit%2Bpush%2Bazure%2Bmaster%2B.png" data-original-width="1600" data-original-height="900" class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
You can then go back to the Microsoft Azure "Try Azure App Service" this time to use the button "Edit your code online" and check online what the deployment has really done.

You will notice that all was not overwritten and that it remains the files present at the creation of the App Service. But main files as server.js was porperly overwritten allowing our project to work. 
<br>
For testing just hit the "run" button flagged in the previous screenshot. 
<br>
The App Service root wiil give this error.

<br>
<br>
But if we add the segment
<br>
/contacts
<br>
to this url, Chrome will display the response in the browser in a json format (Internet Explorer would have asked you to download the result as a file).
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jHKhX5drB8g/Wes1IdBXL9I/AAAAAAAAThE/gFbKysJCb4kFbodoOWWs5lTgPUEkKjkIgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B38%2B-%2BTry%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2BUI%2B-%2BEdit%2Byour%2Bcode%2Bin%2Bline%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jHKhX5drB8g/Wes1IdBXL9I/AAAAAAAAThE/gFbKysJCb4kFbodoOWWs5lTgPUEkKjkIgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B38%2B-%2BTry%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2BUI%2B-%2BEdit%2Byour%2Bcode%2Bin%2Bline%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2B.png"    class="screenshot-large"   /></a>
<br>
<br>
You can then test this super simple API(only GET verb), with swagger by adding to your App Service url the segment:
<br>
/docs/?url=%2Fswagger#/Contacts 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HfJsn7Cp9po/Wes3t1tHRvI/AAAAAAAAThQ/Ee9PQ1JrC_0DF71VemZUNJWD6aaZ-o98QCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B39%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2Bwith%2Bswagger%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HfJsn7Cp9po/Wes3t1tHRvI/AAAAAAAAThQ/Ee9PQ1JrC_0DF71VemZUNJWD6aaZ-o98QCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B39%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2Bwith%2Bswagger%2B.png"    class="screenshot-large"  /></a>
<br>
<br>
Or if you have Postman installed you can use it either
<br>
<br><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7zNXr1qG4/Wes370Lt5DI/AAAAAAAAThU/kSIC7BwJusUd04bST8JHGf0LFf5CEwLTgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B40%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2Bwith%2Bpostman.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KE7zNXr1qG4/Wes370Lt5DI/AAAAAAAAThU/kSIC7BwJusUd04bST8JHGf0LFf5CEwLTgCLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B40%2B-%2Bchecking%2BNode.js%2BApp%2BService%2Bdeployment%2Bwith%2Bpostman.png"   class="screenshot-large"  /></a>

<!--editing Azure App Service online-->
<h2>3 - Edit this REST API online within Azure Integrated Visual Studio Code online</h2>
<br>
<br>
One of the good point of Node.js compared to compiled language like .Net C# is that you can all edit online once deployed. 
<br>
Assume we want to add a new contact to our API. We just have to write it on the proper file (Visual Studio Code online will save it automatically). 
<br>
<br>
<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D8KKkLMHgb0/Wes4xxYDiyI/AAAAAAAAThc/cxohJKXx2PEywTPZrAy-FGMVlk5Fr5raACLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B41%2B-%2Bediting%2Bcode%2Bonline%2B.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-D8KKkLMHgb0/Wes4xxYDiyI/AAAAAAAAThc/cxohJKXx2PEywTPZrAy-FGMVlk5Fr5raACLcBGAs/s1600/Try%2BAzure%2BApp%2BService%2B-%2B41%2B-%2Bediting%2Bcode%2Bonline%2B.png"   class="screenshot-large" /></a>
<br>
<br>
Then, we could test our change on Chrome or in Postman. 
<br>

Personally I love this Azure Feature. I will post more using it: 
<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
We will test the functions
</li>
<li>
We will test the Azure Web App
</li>
<li>
I will publish a post for the Node.js newbie, on how to mount from scratch the API we have deployed in this post, and we will also take benefit of that to add more verbs to our API, POST, PUT, DELETE. 
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Enjoy folks!
